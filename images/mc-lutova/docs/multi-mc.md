# MultiMC

You can find [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) available for download on their site
[https://multimc.org/](https://multimc.org/).

## Instances

Add a new instance with the correct version for the server e.g. `1.9.1`.

## Install Fabric

I use Fabric as the modloader if you press edit instance, you can find the button to Install Fabric on the *Version*
tab.

## Copy the Mods

Copy the mods from the supplied `zip` file. Message me directly or check discord for the link to the `zip`. You'll want
to unzip the file and copy all the `.jar` files into the *Loader Mods* tab.

If you have trouble with the incorrect java runtime you can find that in the settings tab highlighted in the above
photo, this is also where you can increase the RAM the JVM is able to use for this instance, I recommend allocating at
least 4GB.
